This repository contains my personal Ansible roles.

**They do not intend to be generic and ready-to-use.**

However, fell free to read/use/extend them and to contact me if you have
any questions.

----

Please make sure you read and understand every role before running
it. Otherwise, you'll possibly loose something you love.

Ah, did anyone tell you already to always have recent backups?

* default target systems
    * apt-based
    * Debian(-based)
